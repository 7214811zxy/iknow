A website for visualizating the basic image recognition algorithm, just like Tensorflow Neural Network Playground(https://playground.tensorflow.org/)

Thanks to TensorFlow and the cs231 course of Stanford University, let me know the deep learning and image recognition algorithms.

During learning, I find it is interesting to make these incomprehensible algorithm visualizations. Just like the website Tensorflow Neural Network Playground. So I want to make a similar website, but it would focus on the image recognition algorithms.

I have finished some work, based on the Django. Now, the user can choose some pictures from the test databases of cifar-10 and upload any images. The website will use the set algorithm to give a prediction.
